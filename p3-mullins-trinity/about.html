            <h3>Hello there...</h3>
            <p>I'm Trinity, a lover of all things fandom and geek and creator of art and content for social media. I was born in Florida but reside in the mountain state of West Virginia. I received my Bachelor of Science from West Virginia State University in 2017 where I majored in Communications with a focus in filmmaking and visual media and minored in studio art. Afterwards, I took a year off to work in a children's STEAM museum before becoming a social media director and producer.</p><br>

            <p>Soon I decided to persue a Masters degree. I began a two-year program at West Virginia University and (accidentally) finished the degree in a year. In spring of 2020, I received my Master of Arts in Communication specializing in Corporate and Organizational Communications. Also in 2020 I started as an adjunct professor at my alma mater.</p><br>

            <p> I thought my journey would have me pursuing a PhD to stay as a professor, but the pandemic in 2020 had me exploring other avenues. I began streaming on Twitch and hit affiliate within two weeks. I explored cosplay and TikTok and the world of content creation. Soon I realized what I wanted to do was web design and content creation. Early 2021, I began applying to schools for this. During this time, my father passed from COVID-19 after being in a medically induced coma. He passed before learning I made it into my (and his) top pick school, University of Florida. That summer, I started my degree for a Master of Arts in Mass Communication, specializing in web design and online communication.</p><br>

            <p>Most of my free time is spent being a nerd, whether streaming on Twitch or reading or watching films and shows. Marvel,Star Wars, Hunger Games, Letterkenny, and Harry Potter are just a tiny few of my passions. I love incorporating my love of geek life into my art. In October of 2021, I will be lucky enough  to include my love of geek and all things Halloween and spooky in my elopement to my fiance.
